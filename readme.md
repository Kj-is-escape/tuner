#Online tuner
This is a fork of [https://qiuxiang.github.io/tuner/app](https://qiuxiang.github.io/tuner/app/) which makes it usable within other websites, it was built for a specific purpose (using it to create a pvc instrument) it could be greatly improved but I have no plans of improving it myself.     
     
Some possible improvements:
* Adding some visual representation of recorded volume
* Using flexbox and/or structuring the css better to make it more flexible

The online tuner based on web audio api: [https://qiuxiang.github.io/tuner/app](https://qiuxiang.github.io/tuner/app/).
